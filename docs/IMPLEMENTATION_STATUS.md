# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-08-28 UTC.

## Current phase

Phase 7 is independently complete. The Flow/Veo adapter boundary, persistent profile
permissions/login health, three-attempt and credit behavior, and generation handoff
export/import/resume validation are implemented. Live Flow remains externally blocked.

## Baseline quality commands

```bash
python3 scripts/environment_doctor.py
python3 -m pytest
ruff check .
git diff --check
```

This status is intentionally conservative. No integration is considered proven by
the presence of a binary alone, and no mock is acceptance evidence.
