# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-08-28 UTC.

## Current phase

Phase 11 is complete. Configurable lenient QC enforces technical media, Product Truth,
required assets, CTA/audio/duration/dimensions, persists reports, accepts advisories,
and schedules dependency-targeted repair until a controlled budget stop.

## Baseline quality commands

```bash
python3 scripts/environment_doctor.py
python3 -m pytest
ruff check .
git diff --check
```

This status is intentionally conservative. No integration is considered proven by
the presence of a binary alone, and no mock is acceptance evidence.
